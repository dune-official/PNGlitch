# PNGlitch
During development of a PNG library POC, I stumbled upon a weird behaviour... it glitches the image to (almost) beyond reckognition. 

I have had people tell me they look beautiful, so I release it as is. Keep in mind that this is from a proof of concept, so I really don't want to maintain it, since the code is long deprecated already. It should not contain any bugs (if you count that glitch as a feature) , however, I take no responsibility as to what ever might happen to your source images.

I have added a screenshot of a glitched image as an example.

# Usage
`./pnglitcher <input> <output>` or `pnglitcher.exe <input> <output>`

Enjoy and maybe share your creations on r/glitchart, or even make more sophisticated stuff with it. Don't PM me with fixes though, I have already figured out what caused the issue.
